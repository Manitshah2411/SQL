# SQL Views: A Complete Guide

## üîπ What is a View?

A **View** in SQL is a **virtual table** based on the result of a query.

- Unlike a normal table, it does not store data physically (unless it‚Äôs a **Materialized View**).
- It provides a **window** into the data stored in base tables.

---

## üîπ Why Use Views?

### Simplification

- Hide complex queries behind a simple name.
- Example: Instead of writing a long `JOIN` every time, create a view.

### Security

- Expose only selected columns/rows to users.
- Example: Show customer names but hide credit card numbers.

### Consistency

- Ensure business rules are applied consistently (e.g., a view always calculates discounts in the same way).

### Abstraction

- Separate logical data representation from physical storage.

## üîπ Normal Table vs View Table

| Feature      | **Normal Table (Base Table)** | **View Table (Virtual Table)** |
|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Physically stores data. | Logical/virtual table based on a query. |
| **Data Storage** | Data is stored in DB. | No storage (except materialized views). |
| **Updates** | `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` allowed. | Usually **read-only** (some can be updated). |
| **Performance** | Faster (data pre-stored). | Slightly slower (query runs each time). |
| **Use Case** | Permanent raw/transactional data. | Abstraction, security, simplified reporting. |

## SQL Views: Creating, Updating, and Using Views

## üîπ Creating a View

``` sql
-- Create a view for monthly sales
CREATE VIEW monthly_sales AS
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date);
```

Now you can query it like a table:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM monthly_sales;
```

---

## üîπ Updating a View

By default, views are **read-only**.

However, some views are **updatable** if: - They reference a single
table. - No `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`, `HAVING`, `UNION`. - No aggregate
functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, etc.).

‚úÖ Example of **updatable view**:

``` sql
CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
SELECT customer_id, name, email
FROM customers
WHERE active = true;

-- You can update through this view:
UPDATE active_customers
SET email = 'new@mail.com'
WHERE customer_id = 101;
```

‚ùå Example of **non-updatable view**:

``` sql
CREATE VIEW customer_stats AS
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

Here, you **cannot update** because it uses `GROUP BY`.

---

## üîπ Materialized Views

A **Materialized View** is like a normal view but it stores the result
**physically**.

- Faster for repeated queries, especially aggregations.
- Must be refreshed to update data.

Example:

``` sql
-- Create a materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales_mv AS
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date);

-- Refresh when data changes
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales_mv;
```

## üîπ Advantages of Views

‚úÖ Simplify complex queries\
‚úÖ Improve security (restrict access)\
‚úÖ Maintain consistency\
‚úÖ Provide abstraction for BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, etc.)

---

## üîπ Disadvantages of Views

‚ùå Performance overhead (query runs each time for normal views)\
‚ùå Not all views are updatable\
‚ùå Dependency on base tables (if table structure changes, views may
break)\
‚ùå Materialized views need manual refresh

---

## üîπ When to Use Views?

‚úÖ When you want to simplify queries for analysts.\
‚úÖ When you need to restrict access to sensitive data.\
‚úÖ When creating reusable data models for reporting.

‚ùå Avoid using views for write-heavy workloads (performance hit).\
‚ùå Avoid too many nested views (difficult to debug).
